*   **ðŸ”— Depends On:** `Domain Model`.

---

### **2.4. Application Services**

*   **Description:** Contains high-level services that orchestrate domain logic and provide core application capabilities. These services act as the connective tissue between the abstract domain model and the concrete mechanisms, often encapsulating business rules that are not specific to any single mechanism.
*   **ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts:** `FrameFactoryService`, `IdeaService`, `EmbeddingService`, `BudgetManagerPort`.
*   **ðŸ“„ Key Files:**
    *   `nireon_v4/application/services/frame_factory_service.py`

*   **ðŸ”— Depends On:** `Domain Model`, `Kernel`.
*   **ðŸ§  LLM Guidance:** When reasoning about this subsystem, understand that its primary goal is resilience and flexibility. The router abstracts away specific LLM backends, so changes should focus on routing logic, parameter resolution, or circuit-breaking policies, not on hardcoding provider-specific details.

---

### **2.6. Mechanism Gateway**

*   **Description:** A crucial architectural faÃ§ade that provides a single, controlled entry point for all cognitive mechanisms to interact with core system services. By routing all external calls through this gateway, we can enforce policies (like budgets), manage context (via Frames), and maintain a clean separation between mechanism logic and infrastructure concerns.
*   **ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts:** `MechanismGatewayPort`, `MechanismGateway`, `CognitiveEvent`. This is the primary interface used by all mechanisms.
*   **ðŸ“„ Key Files:**

*   **ðŸ”— Depends On:** `Mechanism_Gateway`, `Application_Services`, `Event_and_Signal_System`.
*   **ðŸ’¡ LLM Guidance:** The core intent is to generate novel and divergent variations. When analyzing or refactoring, prioritize logic that enhances creativity and exploration breadth/depth. Avoid adding logic that is overly critical or evaluative, as that is the Sentinel's role.

---

### **2.9. Sentinel Mechanism**

*   **Description:** An evaluative agent responsible for quality control. The Sentinel assesses ideas against multiple axesâ€”such as alignment with objectives, feasibility, and noveltyâ€”to produce a `trust_score`. This score determines whether an idea is "stable" enough to proceed or should be rejected. It is the primary gatekeeper in the idea lifecycle.
*   **ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts:** `SentinelMechanism`, `IdeaAssessment`, `TrustAssessmentSignal`.
*   **ðŸ“„ Key Files:**

    *   `nireon_v4/components/mechanisms/sentinel/config.py`
*   **ðŸ”— Depends On:** `Mechanism_Gateway`, `Application_Services`, `Event_and_Signal_System`.
*   **ðŸ’¡ LLM Guidance:** The core intent is critical, objective evaluation against defined axes. The LLM's role here is to provide structured, parseable JSON output, not creative text.

---

### **2.10. Catalyst Mechanism**

*   **Description:** A synthesis-focused agent designed to foster creativity by blending concepts from different domains. The Catalyst takes an existing idea and "injects" influence from a specified cross-domain vector, creating a novel, hybrid concept. Its goal is to bridge disciplinary boundaries and spark interdisciplinary thinking.
*   **ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts:** `CatalystMechanism`, `CatalystConfig`, Vector Blending.
*   **ðŸ“„ Key Files:**
    *   `nireon_v4/components/mechanisms/catalyst/service.py`

*   **ðŸ”— Depends On:** `Mechanism_Gateway`, `Application_Services`, `Event_and_Signal_System`.
*   **ðŸ’¡ LLM Guidance:** The core intent is creative synthesis and the blending of disparate concepts. The goal is a surprising but coherent hybrid idea. When analyzing, focus on the effectiveness of the vector blending and the quality of the LLM-generated hybrid text.

---

### **2.11. Math Engine (Principia)**

*   **Description:** A specialized subsystem for performing deterministic, symbolic mathematical computations. It is orchestrated by the `PrincipiaAgent`, which receives a `MathQuerySignal`, offloads the computation to a `MathPort` implementation (like the `SymPyAdapter`) via the Mechanism Gateway, and then uses an LLM to generate a human-readable explanation of the result, which is published as a `MathResultSignal`.
*   **ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts:** `PrincipiaAgent`, `MathPort`, `SymPyAdapter`, `MathQuerySignal`, `MathResultSignal`.
*   **ðŸ“„ Key Files:**
    *   `nireon_v4/components/mechanisms/math_agents/principia_agent.py`
    *   `nireon_v4/infrastructure/math/sympy_adapter.py`
*   **ðŸ”— Depends On:** `Mechanism_Gateway`, `Event_and_Signal_System`.
*   **ðŸ’¡ LLM Guidance:** The LLM's role in this subsystem is strictly for explanation. It translates the structured, symbolic output from the math computation into a clear, human-readable, step-by-step explanation. It should not perform any computation itself.

---

### **2.12. Proto-Plane (Execution & Generation)**

*   **Description:** A powerful subsystem for executing arbitrary, declarative tasks ("Proto blocks") in a secure, sandboxed environment. It consists of the `ProtoGenerator`, which translates natural language into a YAML Proto block, and the `ProtoEngine`, which executes these blocks. This allows for dynamic, on-the-fly creation of complex computational tasks.
*   **ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts:** `ProtoBlock`, `ProtoEngine`, `ProtoGenerator`, `ProtoTaskSignal`, `ProtoResultSignal`.
