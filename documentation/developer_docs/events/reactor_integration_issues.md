Initial State: The FrameOperationError Crash
Problem: The Sentinel mechanism was trying to create a new sub-frame for its assessment, but the parent frame (created by the Explorer) had already been closed. This caused a hard crash.
Fix: We redesigned the Sentinel's assessment_core.py to stop it from creating a new frame. Instead, it was corrected to operate within the existing frame context provided by the triggering signal. This was a critical architectural correction.
State 2: The Gateway Block and Race Condition
Problem: With the Sentinel no longer crashing, the underlying race condition became visible. The Explorer was still closing its frame before the Sentinel had a chance to use it. The MechanismGateway was now correctly blocking Sentinel's LLM call, leading to a timeout because no TrustAssessmentSignal was ever produced.
Fix: This was the most significant change. We made the Explorer stateful. It now:
Subscribes to the TrustAssessmentSignal.
Tracks the ideas it generates within a frame.
Uses asyncio.Event to wait for a TrustAssessmentSignal for each idea it created.
Only after all assessments are received (or it times out waiting) does it close its own frame. This completely resolved the race condition.
State 3: The Data Flow frame_id Error
Problem: The system now ran further but Sentinel failed again, this time because it wasn't receiving the frame_id in its input data. The components were working, but the Reactor rule connecting them was incomplete.
Fix: We edited configs/reactor/rules/core.yaml. In the idea_generated_to_trust_eval rule, we added frame_id: "payload.frame_id" to the input_data_mapping. This told the reactor how to pass the baton correctly.
State 4: The Pydantic Validation Error
Problem: The Sentinel was now getting all the data it needed and correctly producing a trust score (e.g., 6.65), but the TrustAssessmentSignal model expected a score between 0 and 1. This caused a data validation crash.
Fix: A simple one-line change in signals/core.py to update the Pydantic field validator for trust_score from le=1.0 (less than or equal to 1.0) to le=10.0.
State 5: The kwargs TypeError
Problem: The entire chain worked, but when the Reactor tried to trigger the Catalyst mechanism, it passed a template_id that the Catalyst's _process_impl method wasn't defined to accept.
Fix: We made the CatalystMechanism._process_impl signature more flexible by adding **kwargs to it, allowing it to accept and ignore extra arguments.
Final State: The Lingering Timeout
Problem: The log shows everything working, including the GenerativeLoopFinishedSignal being emitted. But the test runner run_explorer_test.py still times out.
Reason: The test runner subscribes to the signal after the Reactor has already processed it and emitted it. The wait_for_signal function sets up its listener, but the event has already come and gone.
Fix: The final, simple fix is in the test runner itself. It's an easy mistake to make in asynchronous testing.
