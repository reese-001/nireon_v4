# Catalyst Mechanism Subsystem

**Description:** A synthesis-focused agent designed to foster creativity by blending concepts from different domains. The Catalyst takes an existing idea and "injects" influence from a specified cross-domain vector, creating a novel, hybrid concept. Its goal is to bridge disciplinary boundaries and spark interdisciplinary thinking.
