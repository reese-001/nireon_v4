# Sentinel Mechanism Subsystem

**Description:** An evaluative agent responsible for quality control. The Sentinel assesses ideas against multiple axesâ€”such as alignment with objectives, feasibility, and noveltyâ€”to produce a `trust_score`. This score determines whether an idea is "stable" enough to proceed or should be rejected.
