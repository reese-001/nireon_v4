One rainy afternoon, she overhears a peculiar conversation between the barista, a mysterious figure named Leo, and a regular customer who seems oddly out of place. Intrigued, Clara strikes up a conversation with Leo, who hints at the shop's \"secret menu.\" \n\nCuriosity piqued, Clara asks for the special drink.
