This paradox not only tickles the funny bone but also serves as a rich ground for a rigorous proof that balances both humor and mathematical reasoning. \n\n**Theorem:**\n\nFor every integer \\( n \\), there exists a banana \\( B(n) \\) such that \\( B(n) \\) can be peeled \\( n \\) times, and upon each peeling, the number of remaining bananas increases by \\( \\pi \\).\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. **Base Case: \\( n = 1 \\)**\n\n   Consider a single banana \\( B(1) \\). When we peel it once, we find another banana inside, a result of the magical properties of this fruit (which, to our amusement, has been known to exist only in the realm of the mathematically absurd). Thus:\n   \n   \\[\n   B(1) \\text{ (peel)} \\rightarrow B(2) \\text{ (one banana becomes two)}",

Clearly, bananas come in various shapes, sizes, and even states of ripeness. For our proof, we will categorize bananas into three major types: Fresh Bananas (FB), Overripe Bananas (OB), and Fictional Bananas (FiB).\n\n2. **Assumption of Finite Bananas**: Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only a finite number of bananas in the universe. This means we can count them all and denote this finite number as \\( n \\). Therefore, we can write:\n   \\[\n   B = \\{ b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n \\}\n   \\]\n   where each \\( b_i \\) is a banana.\n\n3. **The Infinite Banana Party**: Now imagine a vast cosmic event—the Infinite Banana Party (IBP)—where all the bananas in the universe are invited.

However, what if we could combine rigour with a dose of humor? This proof will demonstrate that laughter, much like prime numbers, is infinite and can be derived from a series of amusing premises.\n\n**Theorem: There are infinitely many jokes.**\n\n**Proof:**\n1. **Base Case: The Existence of Jokes**\n   - We start with the well-known joke: \"Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side!\" This is our foundational joke, proving that at least one joke exists. \n\n2. **Inductive Step: The Creation of New Jokes**\n   - Assume we have a finite collection of jokes, denoted as \\( J_1, J_2, \\ldots, J_n \\). We will show that we can create a new joke, \\( J_{n+1} \\), thus increasing the total number of jokes.\n   - Consider the following transformation: Take any joke \\( J_i \\) from our collection and apply a comedic",
